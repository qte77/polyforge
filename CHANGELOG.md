The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Types of changes**: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scripts/generate-workspace.sh`: generates `workspace.code-workspace` (folders only) from `repos.conf`
- WakaTime API key non-interactive setup via `WAKATIME_API_KEY` Codespace secret
- tmux devcontainer feature for `cc-repos.sh` (CLI/SSH usage)

### Changed

- `scripts/repos.conf`: dynamic `POLYFORGE_ROOT` detection (works at any checkout path)
- `workspace.code-workspace` is now generated (added to `.gitignore`)
- `postAttachCommand`: object format with one terminal per repo (no workspace reload)

### Fixed

- Sidebar folders not loading when polyforge is the main Codespace repo (path mismatch)
- Only one terminal on startup — `postAttachCommand` object format opens one terminal per repo
