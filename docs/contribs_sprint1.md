## Merge Patterns (how to get PRs accepted)

| Project | Template | Strategy | Key Requirement |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| openclaude | Summary/Impact/Testing/Notes | Small focused fixes only | `bun run build` + `bun run smoke`, state provider tested |
| SimpleAgents | None (use CONTRIBUTING.md) | Branch-name title, CodeRabbit summaries | Update TODO.md, run tests |
| compass-mcp | None | Direct to main (we set the norms) | Be the founding contributor |
| patent-dev | None | Direct to main (first PR ever) | Tests + clear rationale |
| SWE-bench | Standard | Focused fixes | Harness test coverage |
| tj-actions | Standard | Feature PRs welcome | Well-scoped, one feature per PR |
| release-please | Standard | Google CLA required | Sign CLA first |

## Deferred TODOs

### BayramAnnakov/claude-reflect

- [ ] #25 — pytest not found in CI (quick win, planned)
- [ ] Review + improve PR #26 — CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT fallback (fixes #17)
- [ ] PR #27 — SessionEnd hook (stalled 3 weeks, revive + add tests)
- [ ] Multi-project reflection aggregation — reflect across repos not just one (strategic)

### SWE-bench/SWE-bench

- [ ] #472 — clarify eval output JSON docs (quick win, planned)
- [ ] #474 — check_fail_only evaluates fatal errors as resolved (bug fix, no competing PR)
- [ ] #410 — clarify patch_is_None vs patch_exists (docs)
- [ ] #502 — missing django-7530 test case (dataset fix)
- [ ] #513 — matplotlib large UID files breaking podman (bug fix)

### disler/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability

Demoted — 0 PRs ever merged, 15 stalled. Adopt patterns instead of contributing upstream.
See qte77/Agents-eval#104, #105, #106 for our approach (extract into cc-meta skill).

### tj-actions/changed-files

Demoted — solo maintainer ignores external PRs for months.

- [ ] #2839 — newline separator option (if maintainer becomes responsive)

### googleapis/release-please

Demoted — Google CLA + 20 stalled external PRs.

- [ ] #2696 — `||` vs `??` for header/footer (one-line fix, if CLA signed)

### CraftsMan-Labs/SimpleAgents

- [ ] Add PR template (low-hanging, builds trust)
- [ ] #23 — cyclomatic complexity CI setup (quick win)
- [ ] #42 — human-in-the-loop approval system (high value, Rust)
- [ ] #44 — agentic skills for CC/codex/opencode (strategic, CC skills interop)

### richlira/compass-mcp

- [ ] Tests + CI (vitest + GHA pipeline, founding contributor)
- [ ] `list_contexts` tool (obvious missing feature)
- [ ] Agent identity + multi-workspace (strategic, office-forge coordination)

### Gitlawb/openclaude

- [ ] #448 — status line always 0% (small focused fix)
- [ ] #433 — Ollama tool calling outputs raw JSON (provider bug)
- [ ] #430 — tool call validation strict mode (provider bug)
- [ ] Review/champion auriti PRs #268/#258 (strip Anthropic params from 3P)

### patent-dev/epo-ops

- [ ] #2 — XML parsing bug (well-documented, proposed fix exists)
- [ ] #1 — Go module proxy cache (needs version bump)
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md + PR template

### patent-dev (cross-repo: bulk-file-loader, uspto-odp, dpma-connect-plus, epo-bdds)

- [ ] Add test suites across all 4 repos
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md + CI workflows
- [ ] Cross-library consistency audit

### patoles/agent-flow

- [ ] SSE visualization bugs (#35)
- [ ] Subagent rendering (#31)
- [ ] Polyrepo topology visualization (strategic)

### sangrokjung/claude-forge

- [ ] Marketplace schema bugs (#19)
- [ ] Hook naming/path failures (#15)
- [ ] Port cc-utils-plugin skills as forge plugins

## Workflow

All contributions follow fork-first:

1. Branch on our fork (never push to main)
2. Strict TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)
3. Conventional commits
4. PR to upstream following their template/conventions
