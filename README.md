# polyforge-orchestrator

Orchestrate parallel AI coding agents across
a polyrepo codebase from a single Codespace
or devcontainer.

**For** teams running Claude Code (or other AI agents)
across multiple repos simultaneously.
**Run** `./scripts/cc-parallel.sh --preset validate`
to validate all repos in one command.

## Quick Start

```bash
./scripts/cc-parallel.sh --preset validate
./scripts/cc-parallel.sh --preset security
./scripts/cc-status.sh
```

Repos: edit `config/repos.conf`. Credentials:
set `GH_PAT` as Codespace secret.

## How It Works

On codespace creation (`make setup_all`), polyforge installs
shared tooling (Claude Code, RTK, lychee, markdownlint),
clones all repos from `config/repos.conf`, and generates
`workspace.code-workspace` with terminal tasks per repo.

On attach (`make setup_repos`), it reads each repo's
`devcontainer.json` and runs their `onCreateCommand` +
`postCreateCommand` inside the host container — bridging
the gap where multi-root workspaces only run the host
container's devcontainer lifecycle.

Terminal tasks auto-open via `runOn: folderOpen` in both
VS Code Desktop and Web.
